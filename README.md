# CafeManagementSystem_withbill
my hand typed and crafted project which goes over a cafe management system containing multiple basic functionalities to order multiple items, create itemized bill for user, store everything in different files, create new user accounts and change inventory data through admin account.

The project works from the CafeManagementSystem.java file, package of admin class is being created and imported for very basic encryption.
When you run the code for the first time, make sure to check all the files are in the same folder and use admin account to add content into "inventory.txt" file if it's empty 
feel free to use my code and please comment "//degen05kun" on it if you do!
